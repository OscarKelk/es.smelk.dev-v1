<h1>Hello!</h1>
<p>This is the website for the (highly intelligent) mum insulter.</p>
<h4>How does it work?</h4>
<p>
If you arenâ€™t planning on stealing this highly intelligent wisdom, it is no trouble to share with you the inner workings.<br>

First, it calculates all that it needs to about your fictional mother.<br>

Second, it insults your mother through the highly intelligent system of picking a random yo mama joke.<br>

Third, it tells you a very insulting fact about your mother.<br>
