      <p>We are a non-profit organization and do not accept any donations for our services. If you would like to donate to our organization, please visit the above link.</p>
      <p>Your donation will go towards Smelk Innovations future products, as well as some of our Community Outreach programs.</p>
      <h2 id="outreach">Community Outreach</h2>
      <p><b>Community outreach</b> involves providing professional services, or services of a specific expertise, to a group of people who may not otherwise have access to those services. It is performed where those in need are located.</p>
      <h3>The Smelk Foundation</h3>
      <p>50% of donations paid to the Smelk Foundation are paid in full to homeless people displaced by Smelk offices and affiliated places of business.</p>
      <p>The other 50% of donations are split up as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>25% goes to administration costs</li>
        <li>25% goes to John Smelk (there's no way of getting around this he has to take his share)</li>
        <li>26% goes to building new Smelk offices in low-cost areas</li>
        <li>24% goes to building new Smelk-affiliated places of business. This includes: <ul>
          <li>Smelk coffee shops</li>
          <li>Smelk banks (dealing exclusively in SMD)</li>
          <li>Smelk debt collectors</li>
          <li>Smelk tax offices</li>
          <li>Smelk bagelries, and much much more.</li>
        </ul></li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Other Outreach projects</h3>
      <p>None. Only the Smelk foundation. That's all we got.</p>
      <h2 id="projects">Future Projects</h2>
      <p>We are currently working on re-releasing the Funnyintor and Mom Insulter without any of the required python dependencies. These would live on one of the website pages, and work purely in Javascript, right in your browser.</p>
      <p>In the future, we also plan on building a Smelk Breaking Bad Spoiler machine. This would have a table of all events in Breaking Bad, categorised according to their relative importance. Put in the latest episode you've seen- and prepare for the most effective spoiler you have ever recieved. Optimised for both relative importance and recency to your latest episode viewed. This will be the newest development in spoiler technology since Youtube recaps.</p>
      <p>Additionally, this website in itself is a project (so meta!). Supporting us financiallty will allow us to improve this website, and your Smelk innovations experience. Maybe we could even expand our team.</p>
