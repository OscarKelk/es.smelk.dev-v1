      <h2>Your impact on us</h2>
      <p class="totaldonations">So far, our loyal Smelk supporters have donated $0 to us.</p>
      <p>Donating to Smelk Innovations, your funds go a long way. We have several <a href="#outreach">community outreach</a> programs that we donate a portion of your donation to, as well as to administration costs to keep your favourite company up and running.</p>
      <p>A portion of your funds also go towards supporting our <a href="#projects">future projects</a>. Consider yourself an investor in the future of technology.</p>
      <h2 id="outreach">Community Outreach</h2>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 600">Community outreach</span> involves providing professional services, or services of a specific expertise, to a group of people who may not otherwise have access to those services. It is performed where those in need are located.</p>
      <h3>The Smelk Foundation</h3>
      <p>50% of donations paid to the Smelk Foundation are paid in full to homeless people displaced by Smelk offices and affiliated places of business.</p>
      <p>The other 50% of donations are split up as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>25% goes to administration costs</li>
        <li>25% goes to John Smelk (there's no way of getting around this he has to take his share)</li>
        <li>26% goes to building new Smelk offices in low-cost areas</li>
        <li>24% goes to building new Smelk-affiliated places of business. This includes: <ul>
          <li>Smelk coffee shops</li>
          <li>Smelk banks (dealing exclusively in SMD)</li>
          <li>Smelk debt collectors</li>
          <li>Smelk tax offices</li>
          <li>Smelk bagelries, and much much more.</li>
        </ul></li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Other Outreach projects</h3>
      <p>None. Only the Smelk foundation. That's all we got.</p>
